# Tantillus
My remix of the tantillus, a cross gantry printer from 2012. 
This version uses a frame printed in a single piece, a mosquito/NF Crazy and Vz Hextrudort on top to bring it to a more recent standard. 
The fishing lines have also been swapped over to GT2 Belts for better quality and uses a 2:1 gear ratio on the stepper to the motion components.
